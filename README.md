# News Site

This is my first time building a website. By using knowledge from Technigos pre course I have built a news site that gives you tips and inspiration to your drawing process.

## The problem

I started the process by making a sketch on a paper to give a simply overlook. I used CSS grid and flexbox to create the layout for the website.

When a problem appeared i usually start to look in Chromes inspector and see if I could understand what the problem was, if i could not then google it and test around different theories.

I did not build the website by the perspective of mobile first which I understood later in that it would have been easier if I have done that.

If I had more time I would have made my navbar a bit more fun and more customized for mobile phones.
Also wanted to make a button to scroll the website down.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
